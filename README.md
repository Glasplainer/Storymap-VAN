# Introduction
  This project is done by Geoffrey Zhehao Li from census data from 2006 and 2016 for the city of Vancouver, BC, alongside information from the OpenData portal of the City of Vancouver, in the form of a storymap. The intended audience would be, obviously, the general public. 

  The idea behind the storymap would be due to how Vancouver, BC, being one of the main cities of North American western coast, had been a major destination of immigration, and one would expect to see in a major immigration destination city significant changes as a result of immigration patterns.

  While researching for this project, I decided not to include data from 2011 Canadian census since its long-form portion was replaced by a voluntary survey, thus distorting the data. Also I decided to show census data in bar plots rather than through interactive maps simply due to the census data available are non-geographic in format. 

# Inspiration
The "Saving the Nile" storymap(https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2020/saving-the-nile/index.html) provides much inspiration for my project.

# Structure
The structure of this story map would have included an introductory part, the parts about census data(recent immigrant population, the parts of recent immigrant population from China(not including SARs) and HK, changes in average household size) and two chapters on public infrastructures in relation to changes in recent immigration-related patterns, including one for wayfinder signs and one for Skytrain stations.
